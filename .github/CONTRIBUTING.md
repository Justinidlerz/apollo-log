## Contributing in apollo-log

We ðŸ’› contributions! The rules for contributing to this org are few:

1. Don't be a jerk
1. Search issues before opening a new one
1. Lint and run tests locally before submitting a PR
1. Adhere to the code style the org has chosen

## Required Tools

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org/) for a package manager. Run `pnpm install` at the repository root. Please read the documentation for working with `pnpm` further.

## Before Committing

1. Use at least Node.js v14.0.0 or higher. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) can be handy for switching between Node versions.
1. Lint your changes via `pnpm lint`. Fix any errors and warnings before committing.
1. Test your changes via `pnpm test`. Only Pull Requests with passing tests will be accepted.
